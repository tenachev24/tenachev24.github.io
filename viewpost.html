                        <h2>Sophia - the social Robot?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts.
                        Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as 60 Minutes'
                        Charlie Rose.In a piece for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot
                        behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many
                        Hollywood movies".Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch The Godfather and asked "what's the
                        worst that could happen?"Business Insider's chief UK editor Jim Edwards interviewed
                        Sophia, and while the answers were "not altogether terrible", he predicted it was a step towards
                        "conversational artificial intelligence".At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, a BBC News
                        reporter described talking with Sophia as "a slightly awkward experience".
                        On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced to the United Nations with a brief conversation with
                        the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J. Mohammed.On October 25, at the Future
                        Investment Summit in Riyadh, the robot was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the first
                        robot ever to have a nationality. This attracted controversy as some commentators
                        wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system
                        shutdown could be considered murder. Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize
                        Saudi Arabia's human rights record.As expressed by Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the
                        Institute for Gulf Affairs, "Women (in Saudi Arabia) have since committed suicide because
                        they couldn’t leave the house, and Sophia is running around [without a male guardian].
                        Saudi law doesn’t allow non-Muslims to get citizenship. Did Sophia convert to Islam? What is
                        the religion of this Sophia and why isn’t she wearing hijab? If she applied for citizenship
                        as a human she wouldn’t get it."It has been countered that not being a Muslim is not
                        a formal barrier to being a Saudi citizen, though officials may take it into consideration at
                        their discretion.In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that
                        Sophia would use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her new country of
                        citizenship; Newsweek criticized that "What [Hanson] means, exactly, is unclear".
